# LambdaTestFramework

LambdaTest TEST ID for jsAlert => V4GDH-BFYRT-F6UA1-9IAES
LambdaTest TEST ID for login => RKUJP-JE197-TQNIV-ZFFNR

## üß™ Framework Explanation
This project is a Hybrid Test Automation Framework built using **Selenium WebDriver**, **Java**, and **TestNG**. It is designed to be **flexible**, **maintainable**, and **scalable** for various testing needs.

---

## üîß Framework Capabilities
- **Parallel Test Execution** using TestNG‚Äôs multithreading.
- **Cross-Browser Testing** support (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
- **Dual Environment Support**:
  - Local Execution
  - Remote Execution on cloud providers like LambdaTest.
- **Page Object Model (POM)** structure for separating test logic from UI locators.
- **Dynamic Environment Control** through a central `BaseClass`.
- **Data-Driven Testing**:
  - Test data (e.g., login credentials) is read from an Excel file using a custom Excel Utility.
- **Advanced Reporting** using **Extent Reports** for clear and detailed test results.

## üîÅ Execution Workflow
1. The test execution starts by reading configurations from the `config.properties` file.
2. You define the environment (local or remote), browser, and other parameters in this config file.
3. Based on the configuration, the `BaseClass` initializes the WebDriver and sets up the appropriate environment.
4. Test data such as login credentials is fetched from Excel files.
5. You then run the desired test suite by executing the appropriate **TestNG XML file**.
6. After execution, detailed test reports are generated using **Extent Reports**.
